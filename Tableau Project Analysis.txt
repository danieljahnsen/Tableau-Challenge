Citi Bike Analytics

I decided to look at what factors determine to average trip duration while riding a Citi Bike. 
The data set includes all citi bike trips in 2020 in the Jersey City area. 
I was able to create a union of 12 csv files in Tableau to create a 2020 dataset.
There are two different parts of the analysis.

Part 1
This part looked at the total number of trips per station along with the average trip duration from each station.
My initial thought was that the stations with higher trip counts would have a lower average trip duration. Just because the more trips the lower the average would be based on the map.
This appeared to be the case, however it looks more interesting when you map the trip counts and trip durations.
The stations with the higher trip counts appear to aggregate toward the center of Jersey City.
While the stations with higher average trip durations appear in more remote locations on the edge of the area.
This would make sense since the more remote the location, the longer the expected ride would be.

Part 2
The second part looked at the average trip duration per station versus the average age of the rider per station.
As shown in the line graph, average trip duration tends to decrease as average rider age increases.
Next, I wanted to see if age would effect the average trip duration more than location by displaying the average trip durations per station as average age increases.
There was no obvious change in trip duration based on rider age per station. And as shown on the map, average rider age is very much the same per station.


This was a very interesting data set to view and I enjoyed working with the CityBike data.
